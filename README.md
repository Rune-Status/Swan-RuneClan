# Oerview

RSClan was originally supposed to be a simple project made for a friend a while ago. While it still is fairly simple, it gave me the opportunity to learn how to not only use python, but to write clean, clear, and concise code. You can see this difference between the original and in the python versions.

# RuneScape Clan Lookup

This program uses the RuneScape api to grab the list of members from a given clan on RS3. 

The repository features both the original program written in C#, and a newer version written in Python 3.

You'll need Python 3.x to run the py version.
